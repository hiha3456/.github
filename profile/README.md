# OpenDILab.github
The first decision intelligence platform covering the most complete algorithms in academia and industry.
Since July 2021, OpenDILab has been officially open sourced at the opening ceremony of **World Artificial Intelligence Conference(WAIC)**. 

As an important part of OpenXLab from Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Laboratory, OpenDILab is committed to being a **decision intelligence platform**, which covers the range from the most ***complete academic algorithms*** to ***industrial scales***. OpenDILab has a complete set of decision intelligence training and deployment frameworks, covering the application ecological layer, algorithm abstraction layer, asynchronous distributed management layer and distributed execution layer, being suitable for full-scale scheduling system optimization from single machine to thousands of CPU/GPU joint training.
