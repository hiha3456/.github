The first decision intelligence platform covering **the most complete algorithms and applications both in academia and industry**.
Since July 2021, OpenDILab has been officially open sourced at the opening ceremony of **World Artificial Intelligence Conference(WAIC)**. 


As an important part of OpenXLab from Shanghai AI Laboratory, OpenDILab is committed to being a **universal decision intelligence platform**, which has a complete set of training and deployment frameworks, covering ***application ecological layer, algorithm abstraction layer, distributed management layer and distributed execution layer***, being suitable for full-scale scheduling system optimization from single machine to thousands of CPU/GPU joint training.

OpenDILab contributes to integrating the latest and most comprehensive achievements in academia and solving complex problems which are difficult to standardize in the industry. Our future vision is to promote the leap of AI development **from perceptual intelligence to decision intelligence**, leading AI technology to a higher level of general intelligence era.
