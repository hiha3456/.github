# OpenDILab
The first decision intelligence platform covering **the most complete algorithms and applications both in academia and industry**.
Since July 2021, OpenDILab has been officially open sourced at the opening ceremony of **World Artificial Intelligence Conference(WAIC)**. 

As an important part of OpenXLab from Shanghai AI Laboratory, OpenDILab is committed to being a **universal decision intelligence platform**, which covers the range from the most ***complete academic algorithms*** to ***industrial scales***.
